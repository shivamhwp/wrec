Wrec records displays or windows with a native ScreenCaptureKit pipeline, writes
hardware-encoded `.mov` files, and gives you both a native SwiftUI menu-bar app
and a JSON-friendly CLI for scripts and agents.

> [!NOTE]
> Wrec is still early public software. Release builds are not notarized, so
> macOS blocks the first launch of an app downloaded with a browser. The
> install script below is not affected (and neither is the CLI); if you drag
> the app in from a browser download instead, clear the quarantine
> recursively (the nested helpers are quarantined separately) and reopen:
> ```bash
> xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Wrec.app
> ```

## Features

- Native SwiftUI menu-bar app with no capture code in the UI process.
- Standalone `wrec` CLI for terminals, scripts, and coding agents.
- Display and window capture.
- HEVC by default, with H.264 available.
- 30 FPS and 60 FPS recording.
- Resolution controls for 720p, 1080p, 2K, 4K, and native capture.
- Cursor capture, system audio capture, microphone capture, and Wrec-window hiding toggles.
- Pause, resume, stop, queued jobs, and recording status.
- JSON output for target discovery, job control, errors, metrics, and logs.
- Local recording history and metrics stored separately from media files.

## Architecture

The app and CLI are thin clients for the same local recording service. The
SwiftUI shell never captures frames itself: both clients send newline-delimited
JSON requests over a Unix socket to the Rust daemon. The daemon owns target
discovery, permissions, the recording queue, job state, controls, history, and
metrics.

For an active job, the daemon launches a separate native Swift capture engine.
ScreenCaptureKit delivers frames directly to AVAssetWriter, which performs
hardware encoding and writes the `.mov` file. Rust coordinates the recording
but never copies or processes video frames.

The app bundle contains `wrec-app`, `daemon`, and `capture-engine`. The
standalone CLI package contains `wrec`, `daemon`, and `capture-engine`, so both
interfaces use the same protocol and recording pipeline.

## Install

**The app**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://wrec.app/install-app | sh
```

The installer downloads the latest release, verifies its checksum, and
installs it into `/Applications` with no Gatekeeper warning (curl downloads
are never quarantined). You can also download the build from
<a href="https://github.com/shivamdoting/wrec/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Releases</a>
and drag it into `/Applications` yourself — see the quarantine note above.
Either way the app then updates itself in place: About → Check for updates
(the update is digest-verified and relaunches without the Gatekeeper
warning).

**The CLI** — for terminals, scripts, and coding agents:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://wrec.app/install | sh
```

The CLI installer grabs the archive for your Mac, installs the runtime
under `/usr/local/lib/wrec`, and places a managed wrapper at
`/usr/local/bin/wrec`. Update it later with `wrec update` (or check first
with `wrec update --check`).

## Requirements

- macOS 15+.
- Apple Silicon (M-series) Mac. Intel Macs are not supported yet.
- Screen Recording permission for the app or terminal.
- Audio Recording permission when system audio capture is enabled.
- Microphone permission when microphone capture is enabled.

## Runtime Paths

App config and SQLite data:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/Wrec
```

Default recording output:

```text
~/Movies/<app name>
```

Daemon files for local automation:

```text
~/.wrec/wrec.sock
~/.wrec/daemon.log
```

Set `WREC_HOME` to override the daemon directory for tests or isolated agents.

## Contributing

Building from source, development checks, and packaging live in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Wrec's north star is recording efficiency:
low memory footprint, low CPU usage, and clear controls for people and agents.
